          Unexpected fare at New Zealand Cafe
        </b>
      </h3>

        By all rights, one would expect a place called New Zealand Café to serve
        New Zealand Mussels, New Zealand Spring Lamb, and Cloudy Bay Sauvignon
        Blanc, since these are what we've come to love of this island (or
        islands) nation.

        Admittedly, my knowledge of Middle Earth is limited, even though I
        receive daily e-mails about the cost of the Charlotte to Auckland
        roundtrip ticket (thank you, Travelocity), and I made my family sit
        through Whale Rider twice. I have eaten an occasional pavlova, which is
        a meringue named for a long-dead ballerina; hokey pokey, as in do it and
        turn around; and gingernuts, which are rock hard biscottis.
      </p>

        So when New Zealand Café Seafood Grill & Sushi Bar, located in a
        non-descript small strip shopping center off Sardis Road North, opened
        last April, I popped right in to see what they had. But they were not
        offering pavlovas nor mussels. Instead, they had Japanese tempura, sweet
        and sour Chinese dishes, and sushi. Undoubtedly, as the world becomes
        ever smaller, the cultural distinctions of cuisines will be as melded as
        the people. According to the 2001 New Zealand census, the Asian
        population is expected to double by 2016 and more than one third of the
        residents of Auckland will be Asian. New Zealand fare is a variation and
        adaptation of the foods from the various ethnic groups that make up the
        population -- hence the menu.

        New Zealand's co-owner is Hong Kong native Jackie Chen, who said his
        spot is a franchised concept owned by David Zhou of New Zealand and is
        similar to the Queenstown Bistro in Columbia, SC, and another Café in
        Auckland, New Zealand. The South Carolina bistro, however, is a full
        service restaurant with live music and higher menu prices.
      </p>
      <p>
        New Zealand is a small, 40-seat cafe with an even smaller four-seat
        sushi bar area to the rear of the dining room. On one side, the
        faux-finished walls sport sconces, and the other side has a television
        and large beach painting. A dropped wooden arbor with creeping plastic
        greenery extends across the ceiling. Tall round bar tables are gathered
        toward the sides while a few dining-sized tables fill the middle.
        Servers breeze in and out of the kitchen delivering dishes as they're
        prepared rather than for the table as a whole.
      </p>

        The menus, which remain the same all day, are heavily influenced with
        Japanese items. A sushi list contains 30 or so rolls. Another menu
        offers dishes from New Zealand. Was it Gollum who talked about the
        juicy-sweet fish? If so, he probably meant the Chilean sea bass, which
        is totally submerged in a too thick and cloyingly sweet ginger soy
        sauce. The taste of the fish had been perfectly eclipsed. Another New
        Zealand choice is the fried pork chop, which is sliced and also
        overdosed with a sweet sauce. The New Zealand chicken turned out to be
        small battered chunks of white meat, again set in a sea of sweet, but
        this time flecked with heat. If you're an aficionado of sweet and sour,
        these dishes are up your alley.

        Better was the pristine, thinly sliced, rare ahi tuna appètizer with a
        mound of wasabi. The New Zealand barbecue rib appètizer, however, was
        slightly fossilized. The bento box was a precarious triumph with
        delicate vegetable tempura offerings, scallops and shrimp in a
        refreshing emulsion, and a California roll studded with flavor. The
        extras were good, as well: fried popcorn shrimp or a chicken skewer, a
        crisp green salad with a sweet vinaigrette, fried wontons stuffed with
        cream cheese, and a choice of garlicky lo mein noodles or simple steamed
        white rice.

        Alas, no pavlova for dessert, only restrained Japanese Ice Cream.
      </span>
      <p>
        While many of New Zealand Café's dishes seem to revisit the candy land
        realm -- which should not be a problem given the number of sweet tea and
        Krispy Kreme lovers here -- the prices are a real find. The pork chop
        costs $6.25 and comes with three sides and a salad. In fact, all menu
        entrées are less than 10 bucks and the bento boxes are only slightly
        more -- up to $10.25. New Zealand recently received its beer and wine
        license and plans to expand the wine list, which currently contains only
        a handful of bottles, a few of these from New Zealand.

      <p>
        The owners of this small café got it right by emphasizing takeout --
        especially if they're playing to the locals, whose numbers are
        staggering due to the highest apartment concentrations in the entire
        city of Charlotte. Each time I've visited, takeout meals were snuggled
        beside one another on the back counter.
